# Case Study: Multi-Cloud Disaster Recovery with Terraform, Serverless, and CI/CD

## Executive Summary

In this case study, we present how a healthcare SaaS provider overcame a major outage by implementing a unified disaster recovery (DR) strategy across AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud.

The solution leveraged:
- Terraform for multi-cloud infrastructure provisioning
- Serverless automation (AWS Lambda, GCP Cloud Functions, Azure Functions)
- CI/CD-integrated DR playbooks for proactive testing

The result: a 96% drop in recovery time and 99.98% SLA compliance.

## Client Overview

Industry: Healthcare SaaS  
Users: 1,000+ clinics in the U.S. and Canada  
Key Features:
- Appointment scheduling
- Secure messaging
- Telehealth integration
- EHR system sync

Cloud Providers Used:
- AWS
- Azure
- Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

---

## The Challenge

During an AWS us-east-1 outage, the client's platform experienced:

- 6+ hours of downtime
- No DNS failover automation
- High risk of SLA breach
- Inability to reroute traffic to Azure or GCP
- Manual, untested disaster response

---

## Goals

1. Implement cross-region failover in AWS, Azure, and GCP  
2. Automate DNS and traffic redirection using serverless functions  
3. Build multi-cloud DR testing into CI/CD workflows  
4. Ensure compliance with healthcare-grade SLAs

---

## The Solution

### 1. Terraform for Unified Multi-Cloud Provisioning

- Built reusable modules for each provider
- Deployed identical infrastructure across:
  - AWS (us-east-1, us-west-2)
  - Azure (centralus, westeurope)
  - GCP (us-central1, europe-west1)
- Ensured encryption, tagging, and audit logging standards across all clouds

### 2. Smart DNS Failover

Primary Tooling:
- AWS Lambda
- Route53 health checks

Workflow:
1. Lambda detects region failure via CloudWatch alarms
2. Automatically updates Route53 DNS to redirect to secondary AWS region
3. For non-AWS workloads, DNS updates routed to GCP or Azure endpoints

### 3. Redundant Functions in Azure & GCP

- Azure Functions monitored telemetry with Application Insights
- GCP Cloud Functions watched Pub/Sub triggers for failover events
- Both rerouted internal traffic and scaled backend workloads automatically

### 4. DR Automation in CI/CD

Using GitLab CI:

- Stage `dr-test` simulated failure scenarios with chaos testing tools
- Stage `validate-dr` confirmed health of all regions and cloud endpoints
- Logs and evidence pushed to ELK stack for audit trail

## How to Implement This Project in Your Company

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Here2ServeU/multicloud-dr-case-study.git
cd multicloud-dr-case-study
```

### Step 2: Customize Terraform Modules
- Navigate to `terraform/`
- Modify region, backend config, and project variables for your environment

### Step 3: Provision Infrastructure by Cloud Provider
```bash
cd terraform/aws && terraform init && terraform apply
cd ../azure && terraform init && terraform apply
cd ../gcp && terraform init && terraform apply
```

### Step 4: Deploy Serverless Functions
- AWS: Deploy Lambda scripts from `functions/lambda/`
- Azure: Deploy Functions from `functions/azure/`
- GCP: Deploy Functions from `functions/gcp/`

### Step 5: Integrate CI/CD DR Playbooks
- Use GitLab/GitHub CI workflows to run scripts in:
  - `pipelines/dr-tests/` for simulating failure
  - `pipelines/validation/` to confirm infrastructure readiness

### Step 6: Test and Monitor
- Simulate outages monthly
- Review logs and failover timing in CloudWatch, ELK, GCP Ops, and Azure Monitor

## Impact & Results

| Metric                     | Before         | After          |
|---------------------------|----------------|----------------|
| Recovery Time Objective   | 8 hours        | 20 minutes     |
| Recovery Point Objective  | 4 hours        | 15 minutes     |
| SLA Compliance            | 96%            | 99.98%         |
| Incident Response Time    | 45 mins manual | 5 mins automated |
| Estimated Annual Savings  | N/A            | $400,000+      |

---

## Lessons Learned

- DR must be treated as a first-class citizen in architecture design
- Serverless tools reduce recovery time without increasing ops overhead
- CI/CD can validate not just code, but infrastructure resilience

---

## Tools Used

- Terraform (modular provisioning)
- AWS Lambda + Route53
- Azure Functions
- GCP Cloud Functions
- GitLab CI/CD
- CloudWatch, Application Insights, GCP Monitoring
- ELK Stack for centralized logging
